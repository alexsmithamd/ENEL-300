# ENEL-300
ENEL 300 Project Repo

This github repo will be used as the home of all project components. Code, CAD, general design work will be documented and stored here as well as one drive. 

### Guidelines
- Each module's directory contains a `pcb_design`, `print_3d_files`, and a `stm_code` sub-directory. Please organize your module's respective files in the correct directory. 

- The `print_3d_files` is NOT to be used for CAD files, but rather as an easy way to share STLs and slicer files so that we can effectively share the print workload amongst ourselves.

- **Avoid working in the same directory or on the same files as someone else - at the same time!!!**

This can create "merge conflicts" which can be difficult to resolve.

Each module directory contains a `README.md` file. I would highly recommend putting documentation for your module in that file as it simplifies our workflow for everyone. Instead of having to look in OneDrive, one simply needs to do a `git pull` command to get the latest work and documentation!

### Editing Markdown (.md) Files
Markdown is similar to LaTeX. It has very simple syntax and is used everywhere. **For editing, I would recommend VsCode with the following extension installed:**

This gives you the ability to edit and live preview your work as shown below:
